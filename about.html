            In 1886, Bobby Laque constructed his home in Key West on the famous Duval Street for his family of 7.
            The home’s nine bedrooms were carefully planned and decorated by Bobby’s wife Barbara,
            who believed that every room should be unique for every one of her unique children.
            As the children grew older and started to move out, the house appeared emptier and emptier every day to Bobby and Barbara.
            Barbara began to give out rooms to travelers who needed to stay somewhere overnight.
            Her hospitality was always warm and she even cooked breakfast for her guests.

            In 1936, Bobby’s oldest son took ownership of the house and continued in his mother’s footsteps and made the house
            into a Bed and Breakfast. He named it the B&B Willow Lake for Bobby and Barbara.
            Their favorite vacation spot as a family was at their lake cottage in Indiana.
            The family grew a giant willow tree at the cottage that still exists today.
            The house has been pasted down generation to generation, and as to this day,
            a Laqua still owns and operates the house as one of Key West’s finest Bed and Breakfast establishments.
            In 1995, the B&B Willow Lake was refurbished but still remained intact with its 19th century features and decorated style.
