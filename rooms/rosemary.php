                        Featuring romantic burgundy and gold colors, this room is our most requested anniversary suite.
                        In the room is a queen sized bed, a whirlpool for two, and glass windows for an extra touch of romance.
                        You can even fall asleep with the fireplace (across from the bed) toasting you to lovely dreams.
                        The room also has a private bathroom with a bathtub and plenty of space.
                        We highly recommend this room to those celebrating an anniversary or a wedding.
                        Features include cable TV, a DVD player, and free Wi-Fi
